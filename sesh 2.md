*In Artisinal district root can emit faint light. Green.*

*A guy Kawanatenahu, someone who might know shit. Occi Jong and Aster entered a shop to see this guy, oh it's a book shop.* 

*Temok: painter, occi is looking for em (his backstory stuff). 1 gold and 9 copper, apparently a good number. They enter a dungeon in the book shop. Temok has same line tattoos as occi. Occi comes from Akatira.*

Tommy looking forv vest. Salania, baby blue to dark navy. Celestial pattern, cute stars. Some moon stuff there too. In the market it's amazing. Vest navy blue and autistic strawberries. I took the latter.

Tommy saw Jong and Occi in the artisinal district.

*Aianaye Find souvenir for young child, a girl, Lakshmi. Oh yeah she did a lot for her like made her go to school. *

Hyong Se Gallery. So now Tommy knows that Jong knows someone. Gona meet at Ratham Ula the next day.

*Apparently there's a magic shop around here. But anyway, Occi got creeps for some reason, he sees a blue air genasi. He goes for him sneakily. Same guy that stole his stuff*

*Aianaye goes to the slums for the girl. The girl is bullied. Aianaye gona go to the school apparently lol.*

*Jong goes home in the living district. Cracking of glass under your feet. His mother in the corner not doing anything, looks terrified. Asked for flower, got really scolded cuz he forgot flowers. It's because of him that HES dead. his brother is dead because of him (her words). She's like a tiger mom.*

*Occi looking for the blue guy. Someone attacks him. Then everything becomes fuzzy. Its in an alley. The attack was shots by arrow. *

I get an envelope in the morning. Signed by YK. Invitation by Gagan, Yash Kumar to watch the horse race, invitation extends to the whole group. 

*Mom proly got big mental problem or something. She's super kind in the morning to JongMin.*

Aster is from... Avian's reach. In the southern root in Vriksha Rajya there's a mountain range which could maybe have bird people.

*Jongmin and Aianaye seems to have a connection to Yash Kumar.*

We go to the book shop with Jong Min. The shopkeeper is a halforc. The shopkeeper is on me. He told me to pay 20 gold for information. 

We go to Yash Kumar's office. Grey hair. He's wearing Kurtha, super rich vibes. The (stolen) swords apparently give fresh water. He proley fled to El Maghreb El Wafer. Apprently chose us because we have no affiliations and he sorta just want us to get lucky. 300 gold price.

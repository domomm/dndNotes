- The guy I killed that realy messes things up: he goes to the harbor town (the harbor itself as well), would go to the uni of the KR, he goes on a fishing boat (big one), goes to the chinese port town as well. At least upper middle class. Method of killing: got to his place, timed it right. He was home alone and I attempted, missed the first shot, a wee scuffle here and there, but I eventually killed him. But I left a mess.
- I leave my bf without no notice

	Sharav, from Khunnu (Mongol region), met her in Emerald's gate (chinese region port town), was there cuz I was looking for a job.
	
	met Zoey (place holder for Zhin's char). Was in the Chinese region still and in the central city. Leaving Chinese region after about 3 months (still tbd), in this time period I met Zoey. Gradual increase of tension, meeting Zoey is the breakpoint of the realization that I have to leave.
	
	Incident w Zoey with her power, so she looked for me.
	
	I got an informant in a restaurant or sumn (placeholder name: Rasa Jawa). I'd go there as well w Zoey's mom and eat like normal. We often go there together, works as a cover as well. This is what Sharav told Zoey where to find me basically.

General ideas:

- Want to be an assassin, class rogue, subclass arcane trickster (this is honestly mostly because magic is more fun, so the subclass could also change).
- Almost definitely from the native american region
- want to have some sort of fallout with a certain government: basically the idea is that he was a regularly hired hitman for a certain government (still not sure which), then there was a coup, then I'm a target as well. I managed to escape but now I've been living on the run. However, this is quite a while ago, so it has kinda died down a little bit but I would defo be in danger if I approach the new government plus there is still some bounty hunters looking for him
- Since he's living on the run, he's had multiple names, let's say for now he's had 3: Kage Watanabe, Batu Ranang, Mylo Rosales. Batu being the most recent.
- Why assassin in the first place: maybe started out as a hunter in his tribe, his only brother got killed (basically another member killed a holy animal, but blamed the brother instead, they all went to trial but Tommy's family lost and the brother was sentenced to death), who's basically his bestfriend but also the parents' favorite son. Family ashamed by society Mother He ennacted revenge with a help of 

Some questions to think about:
1. Does your character ask a lot of questions about their missions? At the moment of campaign start, I don't think so, but before maybe. Really still need a core reason why he start assassinating.
2. Are they wealthy? Right now, absolutely not. When worked with the fallen government, probably yeah.
3. How did they get into assasination? Good fucking question
4. You said that he would have a son? What about a wife? Yes okay so I want him to have a daughter. I want him to be separated, and basically have no realtionship with her beacuse it would endanger her. I want something traumatizing the character to not come back to his daughter so he doesn't really have a realtionship with her. But then one day her mother died and she needs him.
5. Would he change a lot of his appearance after being hunted? Oh yes definitely

final(ish) ideas:
- Early life: Father was a monster hunter, but got killed in a hunt. Mother gone coocoo, now its just him and his brother (Tahoma). Tahoma was like the only one that can kinda calm their coocoo mother down. They went to a hunt together with some other hunters as well, one of the other hunter killed something that's forbidden to kill, but accused Tahoma instead. Cuz the dude that killed him is like from an important fam in the tribe, people favor him. This went to court, Tahoma was found guilty and sentenced to death. Mother went even more coocoo and killed herself.
- First assassination: Tahmelapachme (Let's just call him Tommy) got really depressed because all this. Now the family of the kid that accused Tahoma, let's call em {Ackerman} has a political rival family in the tribe as well (or even another tribe, we'll see), let's call the rival {Barton} for now. A member of the Barton family saw this as an opportunity to use Tommy to enact revenge on the Ackerman kid. The goal was to distraught the family and eliminate them from the politics seats or sumn. Cuz Tommy was desperate and basically got nothing better to do, he killed the Ackerman killed.
- Working with the Barton: After the first assassination the Barton fam saw potential and basically adopted him. But they're merely using him to assassinate political rivals.
- Eventually Tommy escaped the Barton to get a better life (morality wise). Past the mongolian region and onto the oriental region. There he worked some honest jobs but not realy doing real well in life.
	- option 1: Got a wife and a daughter (one of the options, see below), live a somewhat poor but peaceful life. At one point need something real bad but got no money. Someone somehow found out that I was the assasin the Barton. Started hiring me and gave me lots of good money. But at some point I killed someone who I shouldnt have killed.
	- option 2: things are not going well (fukced whores and became alcoholic), but tehn I got a good boyfriend that brought me up. At one point he got sick and I need money. Then I started killing. The daughter, come a wee before the campaign starts, she was the daughter of one of the whores I guess and then she looked for me and found me boom.
- The guy I killed that realy messes things up: he goes to the harbor town (the harbor itself as well), would go to the uni of the KR, he goes on a fishing boat (big one), goes to the chinese port town as well. At least upper middle class. Method of killing: got to his place, timed it right. He was home alone and I attempted, missed the first shot, a wee scuffle here and there, but I eventually killed him. But I left a mess.
- Nothing realy happens until like a few years later (just before the start of the campaign). Eyes are suddenly on me and I got hit here and there in public or sumn. 
	- Option 1: So I called in a favor that I obtained somehow from a (small) crime organization and smuggled out my fam to the filipino region (wife and kid). I run away alone to assure their safety. Conencted by a sending stone
	- option 2: My husband got killed and I run away with my bastard daughter.

I leave my bf without no notice

Sharav, from Khunnu (Mongol region), met her in Emerald's gate (chinese region port town), was there cuz I was looking for a job.

met Zoey (place holder for Zhin's char). Was in the Chinese region still and in the central city. Leaving Chinese region after about 3 months (still tbd), in this time period I met Zoey. Gradual increase of tension, meeting Zoey is the breakpoint of the realization that I have to leave.

Incident w Zoey with her power, so she looked for me.

Forbidden city, tehre's the emperor, there's the imperial throne. Only women?? They do all sort of the jobs, run by women. Governed by the emperor.

I got an informant in a restaurant or sumn (placeholder name: Rasa Jawa). I'd go there as well w Zoey's mom and eat like normal. We often go there together, works as a cover as well. This is what Sharav told Zoey where to find me basically.

# After Amadahy's death
1.  Unega's verbal abuse: Unega would often berate Tommy for not being as good a hunter as Tahoma, or for not being as mature as his older brother. She would say things like "Why can't you be more like Tahoma?" or "Your father would be ashamed of you." These words cut deep into Tommy's self-esteem, making him feel worthless and unloved.
	a. Tommy was sitting outside his family's tent, trying to sharpen his knife. He was having trouble getting the blade to a fine edge, and he was starting to get frustrated. As he worked, Unega came out of the tent, carrying a basket of berries she had gathered in the woods. She looked at Tommy's knife and snorted. 
			"Can't even sharpen a knife right," she muttered. "You're useless, your father would've done that in minutes"
			Tommy felt a surge of anger and hurt rise up in him. He knew his father had been a skilled hunter, and he was determined to follow in his footsteps. But Unega's words cut him to the core. He set down the knife and stood up, facing his mother.
			"I'm trying my best," he said, his voice shaking with emotion.
			Unega set down the basket of berries and stepped closer to Tommy. She looked him up and down, a sneer on her face.
			"Your best isn't good enough," she said. "You'll never be a real hunter like your father or your brother. You might as well give up now and save yourself the trouble."
			Tommy felt tears prick at the corners of his eyes. He wanted to lash out at his mother, to tell her how much her words hurt him. But he knew it would do no good. Instead, he picked up his knife and went back to work, trying to block out the sound of Unega's voice.
		
    
2.  Physical abuse: On occasion, Unega would lash out physically at Tommy, hitting him or pulling his hair. These incidents would often happen when Unega was in a drunken rage, and Tahoma would do his best to shield Tommy from the worst of the blows.
3. Insults and name-calling: Unega would often use hurtful language towards Tommy, calling him names like "useless" or "stupid." She would insult his appearance, saying things like "You're too skinny" or "Your hair looks like a bird's nest." These words would leave Tommy feeling small and worthless, with no way to defend himself.
    
4.  Comparisons to other children: Unega might compare Tommy unfavorably to other children in the tribe, saying things like "Why can't you be more like [insert name here]?" This would make Tommy feel inadequate and ashamed, as if he could never measure up to other people's standards.
    
5.  Threats of abandonment: Sometimes, when Unega was especially angry, she would threaten to abandon Tommy and Tahoma in the wilderness, leaving them to fend for themselves. This would fill Tommy with a deep sense of fear and anxiety, knowing that he might be left alone without anyone to protect him.
6. Tahoma's comfort: When Tommy was feeling down, Tahoma would often take him out into the wilderness to hunt or explore. They would talk about their father and share memories of him, finding solace in each other's company. Tahoma would remind Tommy that their father loved them both equally, and that he was proud of both of them.
    
7.  The aftermath of the abuse: After an episode of abuse from Unega, Tahoma would often clean up Tommy's wounds and help him to feel better. He would offer him food or water, or just sit with him and listen as Tommy talked about how he was feeling. These moments of tenderness and compassion helped to strengthen the bond between the brothers, making them even closer than before.
8. The first time Tahoma took Tommy on a successful monster hunt. After their father's death, Tahoma took it upon himself to teach Tommy everything he knew about hunting monsters. One day, they finally went on a hunt together and successfully took down a dangerous creature. They were both so proud of themselves and of each other, and it brought them even closer.
    
9.  The time they got lost in the wilderness together. They were out hunting and ended up getting lost. It was getting dark, and they had no idea how to get back to the tribe. They had to spend the night in the wilderness, huddled together for warmth. They were scared, but they comforted each other and promised to stick together no matter what. When they finally made it back to the tribe the next day, they were greeted with relief and admiration for their resilience.
    
10.  The time they stood up to a group of bullies together. Some of the other children in the tribe had been teasing and taunting Tommy and Tahoma since their father died, calling them "orphans" and making fun of their mother's behavior. One day, the teasing turned physical, and a group of older boys ganged up on Tommy and Tahoma. But instead of backing down, they stood up for each other and fought back. They didn't win the fight, but they earned the respect of the other children in the tribe, who saw them as brave and loyal to each other.

## Memories to internalize
1. Tahoma and Tommy went on a hunt together, killed a monster (sort of look like a dark purple old angry lion, spits bright orange poison) just the two of them, for the first time. Come home sort of wounded, mom got mad. Tommy was abused more but Tahoma talked some sense to mom (including yelling). Tom went out for air and took care of his own wound, Tah joined short later. They smoked for the first time. Tah promised to get out of the tribe eventually, just the two of em.

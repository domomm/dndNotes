- ## about Wabanaki
	So surrounded by El Maghreb El Wafir (the arabian region) and Khunnu (the mongol region). Close to nature as people. Trade w sand people (from the arabian region) sometimes. One big modern city and the rest are tribes. Some are nomadic some are not. There are 7 big tribes, then there are more that are smaller. Mine is big. The way that they communicate w the big city is through smoke rings. There are 6 pillars for each big tribe except sky tibe (the one in capital). Each smoke has IP address. Sometiems we use hawk for faster messages. Within my tribe we whistle.
	
	### settlements 
	there are 7 big tribes, 6 settlements. There's one big ass capital city. The relationship between the tribe varies, some of em are good some are not. Every settlement has a chief, and has the final say for that tribe, but ofc there's proly some othe rpeople. There's the council of 7 in the capital. They decide shit on the capital and the country as a whole kinda (on the high level basically). The name eludes to the amount fo tribes that are in Wabanaki (the big ones). There are 77 seats to be divided, 11 is GUARANTEED and ONLY for the skytribe. So the others can have more than 11, but also less.
	
	the central tribe, which is the sky tribe. Exceptional flying skills. Strong connection w wind and stars. They trade sky related resources to other tribe (feathers and shit).
	
	nakai tribe (mine) do the hunting. Allowed to hunt in some places that other tribes are not. Due to sacred beast and shit, as a tribe, we dont kill the sacred beast, but we go around it and kill other shit. Pretty good in subterfuge cuz hunting. We go further and further from the capital as nomads then go back.
	
	coastal tribe. in the southern shores, welcome foreigners there. Good food. Good with sea stuff, trade there too, connected with the spirit of the sea.
	
	river tribe. Another nomadic tribe. Follow the river. Act as scout. Fishing skills too and use boats to go through the river.
	
	Fire tribe. Cna harness fire. Use it for cooking and crafting. Make weapons. Also pottery. Good food.
	
	Warrior tribe. Edgy. Defenders of Wabanaki, first called in time of war. They impose their will on other tribes (pretty strong impose, but still subtle). The other tribes basically not strong enough to go against them.
	
	Trade tribe. They have connections w both Khunnu and Sand people (Emews).
	
	Each tribe has some elders, they're super in touch w nature. But they're feeling left behind due to globalizations.
	
	We also have village/tribe represantatives: politicians that study in the capital and can be chosen to be in the seatof the council.

1. Trust issues: Betrayal or abandonment can erode trust in others. The person may find it challenging to trust a new partner fully, fearing that history might repeat itself. This can lead to constant suspicion, jealousy, or difficulty in opening up emotionally.
    
2. Fear of vulnerability: Trauma can make a person reluctant to be vulnerable in a relationship. They may build emotional walls to protect themselves from potential hurt, which can hinder emotional intimacy and closeness.
    
3. Attachment difficulties: Traumatic experiences can affect attachment styles. The person may develop anxious or avoidant attachment patterns, leading to difficulty in forming secure and healthy bonds with their partner.
    
4. Emotional reactivity: Past traumas can result in heightened emotional reactions to triggers related to the betrayal or abandonment. The person may react more intensely to situations that remind them of their past experiences, causing conflicts in the present relationship.
    
5. Self-esteem issues: Betrayal or abandonment can impact self-esteem and self-worth. The person might struggle with feelings of inadequacy or undesirability, leading to self-sabotaging behaviors in relationships.
    
6. Fear of commitment: Trauma can create a fear of commitment or getting too close to someone. The person may avoid long-term relationships or unconsciously sabotage a promising relationship to protect themselves from potential pain.
    
7. Difficulty in communication: Past traumas may hinder effective communication. The person might struggle to express their needs, feelings, and concerns openly, leading to misunderstandings and conflicts in the relationship.
    
8. Repetition of patterns: Unresolved traumas can lead to a pattern of attracting similar toxic or untrustworthy partners. They might unintentionally seek out relationships that replicate past negative experiences, perpetuating the cycle of pain.
    
9. Emotional numbing: To protect themselves from potential pain, some individuals may emotionally detach or numb themselves in relationships. This can lead to emotional distance and dissatisfaction in the relationship.

Possible behaviours:
Given Tommy's background and the traumas he has experienced, there could be several behavioral patterns or issues that he might exhibit in a relationship. Here are some examples, ranging from not so bad to really bad:

1. Not So Bad (Quirks): 
	-  Difficulty expressing emotions: Tommy might struggle to articulate his feelings due to his uncharismatic nature and past traumas. This could make emotional communication challenging in the relationship. 
	- Reserved or stoic demeanor: His Native American upbringing and training as a hunter might contribute to a reserved and stoic personality, making it harder for him to show vulnerability or warmth.
    
2. Moderate Behavior (Potential Red Flags): a. Avoidance of conflict: Tommy might avoid discussing difficult topics or conflicts, leading to unresolved issues in the relationship. b. Overprotectiveness: Due to his protective instincts, he might become overly possessive or controlling, which can strain the relationship.
    
3. Bad Behavior: a. Emotional distancing: Tommy might emotionally withdraw at times, leaving his partner feeling disconnected and unsupported. b. Distrust or jealousy: Given his past betrayal, he might struggle with feelings of jealousy or mistrust, leading to unnecessary conflicts. c. Impulsive decision-making: His criminal past might influence impulsive decision-making, potentially putting the relationship in risky situations.
    
4. Really Bad Behavior: a. Manipulative tendencies: In extreme cases, Tommy's past as a criminal could manifest in manipulative behavior, such as gaslighting or emotional manipulation. b. Violence or aggression: His history in gang wars might lead to violent tendencies, posing a serious threat to the safety of his partner and family. c. Substance abuse: Coping with trauma through criminal activities may also lead to substance abuse issues, affecting the relationship negatively.

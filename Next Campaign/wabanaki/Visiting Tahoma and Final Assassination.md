# Visiting [[Tahoma]]

After the completion of the second assassination, [[Kova]] fulfilled his promise and took Tommy to [[Wiyasaka]] to visit Tahoma. A thing that he did subtly during the visit is that he also kinda scouted the prison a bit. For breaking out someone purposes lol. He did this cuz he knew, there's just a chance of Tahoma never getting out, his plan was to maybe negotiate with Kova so he can do sumn about it.

Anyway, Kova and Tommy went to the prison together, Kova made sure that he was seen by Tahoma during the visit. Tahoma defo noticed him, but this flew over Tommy's head, he was just very happy that he could finally see his brother again. Whereas usually it's Tahoma that talks more between the two brothers, this time is Tommy, and not cuz Tommy is more excited or sumn, it's actually cuz Tahoma is a kinda quiet. Tommy asked about it and Tahoma just told him that it's kinda rough in prison. They were mostly just catching up, but the vibe was kinda off between the two. Tommy defo noticed it. Time was up, Tommy and Kova left.

Upon exitting, Tommy stayed a bit longer in Wiyasaka, he told Kova that he just wanted to stay a few days longer cuz it's his first time there. But he was actually just scouting the prison.

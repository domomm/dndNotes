# Visiting [[Tahoma]]

After the completion of the second assassination, [[Kova]] fulfilled his promise and took Tommy to [[Wiyasaka]] to visit Tahoma. A thing that he did subtly during the visit is that he also kinda scouted the prison a bit. For breaking out someone purposes lol. He did this cuz he knew, there's just a chance of Tahoma never getting out, his plan was to maybe negotiate with Kova so he can do sumn about it.

Anyway, Kova and Tommy went to the prison together, Kova made sure that he was seen by Tahoma during the visit. Tahoma defo noticed him, but this flew over Tommy's head, he was just very happy that he could finally see his brother again. Whereas usually it's Tahoma that talks more between the two brothers, this time is Tommy, and not cuz Tommy is more excited or sumn, it's actually cuz Tahoma is a kinda quiet. Tommy asked about it and Tahoma just told him that it's kinda rough in prison. They were mostly just catching up, but the vibe was kinda off between the two. Tommy defo noticed it. Time was up, Tommy and Kova left.

Upon exitting, Tommy stayed a bit longer in Wiyasaka, he told Kova that he just wanted to stay a few days longer cuz it's his first time there. But he was actually just scouting the prison.
# Intruders

Right after getting back from Wiyasaka, Kova told Tommy that one last assassination need to be executed for justice to be truly served, Tommy has to kill the elder of the Hunter's tribe. Tommy agreed and they started planning it right away. The planning was really pushed, Kova insisted that it's done as fast as possible, he said that the longer we plan, the longer they can set up better defenses, sumn like that. 

Tommy was even unsigned from his regular duties, only physical training. However, in the little free time that he did have, he went hunting with Kele. During one of the hunts, they found two intruders from the Hunter's tribe managed to track them down. After immediate questioning them if there were others, they said no (this is after lots of threats, so a bit of higher chance of truth). At the end, Tommy and Kele were told by Kova to kill them both. They hesitated, felt a bit wrong, but Kova was real insistent, at the end they did.

Yeah that didn't really feel good, didn't exactly feel right. Kova told them that it's for the safety of the tribe, however they wonder why won't we just take them to court or sumn. But who the hell is Tommy for saying this, he took lives for vengeance. This planted a little seed of doubt in Tommy's mind about Kova.
# The Final Assassination

Kova and Tommy made a team and they ventured again towards where the hunter's tribe is, now let's just skip the planning lol, let's just say the plan is A, however, they see that the Elder kept doing his private prayer every week in a nearby shrine alone, which was kinda weird under the circumstances, so maybe this is plan B?? Yeah they checked if there was any trap, anyone watching him, but they confirmed that he was truly alone. So Tommy was sent.

Tommy, although he was very stealthy, was greeted by the Elder. Cool hero about to be killed but knew the killer was coming vibe. The elder then explained to him that he knows about his involvement with the Warrior's tribe and that he was the one that killed both [[Apache]] and [[Mika]]. He then told Tommy that the Warriors tribe is using him to mess with the hunters tribe for political reasons, the elder has done his research and showed him some of the things that not super cool that might be related to the warriors tribe. He even told him Tahoma's involvement in this all.

Obviously Tommy didn't really believe all this, although it made sense. The Elder then also told him that once the warrior tribe is done with whatever they're doing, they will probably use Tommy as a scapegoat. Especially with the fact that he's reported his findings with other tribes and discussed it in private (whether this is a bluff or not, who the heck knows), and if he dies, it would confirm everything. He told him the only way for Tommy to be getting out of this is to become a double agent. 

Okay now Tommy doesn't know shit no more. He was hella confused and panicking. In his quick thinking, he asks if Tahoma can be freed in compensation if he took the double agent role. The Elder said that that it's very hard, but that there's a way to break him out. He would share it if Tommy agrees to double agent. Then Tommy negotiated further by saying that telling him the breaking out info would be some sort of an advance, and also put a knife on the neck. Then they came to an agreement.

Tommy, at this point, saw this as the only way for him to know the truth, to see first who to really trust.

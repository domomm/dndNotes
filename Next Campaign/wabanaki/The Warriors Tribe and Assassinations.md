# Recruitment and early time
Tommy was persuaded to join the [[Warrior Tribe]] saying that he can join the "army" and that they accept misfits. He was persuaded by [[Kova]]. 

Kova said that he was just like him, exiled from his tribe, the [[River tribe]], a long time ago when he was just a teenager. He said that he did some mistakes but then exiled forever. Warrior's tribe accepted him and they became his new family. Tommy believed him, and this is mostly why he accepted his offer. Whether or not this is the truth, no fucking idea.

He didn't exactly join one of the bigger groups of the Warrior tribes. The one that he joined consists of about 100 people, most of them are young adults. It is a semi nomadic group, they don't constantly move, but they don't stay in one place for too long. All of the people there are fighters, ready to fight at a moment notice, they are part of the warrior's tribe afterall.

However, obviously training to fight and fighting is not all they do. Someone has to fetch some food, craft goods, grow plants, and just some everyday life things. Tommy stayed in a long house, which houses like 12 people. It's a bit like a barrack, but with a kitchen and bathrooms. He was told that he was assigned to this "platoon", that he had to follow some combat training, but also help around the tribe a bit.

Eventually, he helped around in herbalism, making potions and shits, but he was also assigned in food gathering, cuz he was a hunter anyway. In herbalism, he was under the supervision of one of the older people in the tribe, [[Aiyana]]. She taught Tommy the basics, and Tommy was basically her assistant. In hunting, Tommy was accompanied by [[Kele]]. Kele used to hunt alone, and well, let's just say that he was not that good. Tommy taught him a thing or two so he could become a better forager/hunter. Kele also turned out to be an exile from another tribe, he came originally from the [[Coastal tribe]].

# First Assassination

After settling in for a week, Kova talked to Tommy about what happened to him. Tommy basically shed everything he experienced. Kova seemed to be real sympathetic. Kova then basically asked him what Tommy wanted to do about that, Tommy said that he felt like vengeance is due, justice had to be served. Kova then basically nudging Tommy to fulfill that impulse by saying that well the Warrior's tribe can help you train this and that. Tommy, blinded by rage, just went along with it, happy that he doesn't just disagree with the idea of vengeance. However, at this point, Kova hasn't exactly said yes to the assassination yet, he's just saying that the tribe can help him with a bit of this and that.

So eventually he trained and trained. Some specialization in combat and even got a bit of subterfuge/stealthy stuff training as well. After about a month of training, he eventually went back to Kova and asked if he could help plan with his vengeance plan, killing Mika. Kova was (pretending to be) reluctant at first, but eventually agreed. They formed a team, and a gameplan. The team consists of 4 people including Tommy. The other's job was simply to set up a little camp close the hunter's tribe. They would be scouting them first, and determine the perfect time to strike.

Through some sneaky beaky like and good espionage, they found out that a hunting party that includes [[Mika]] are gonna go out soon. They know the time and where they are going to go. It's go time. The rest of the team distracted the rest of the hunting by luring a beast which is usually hunted by scattering the hunting party first (Tommy knew the tactic). Mika was then separated.

Tommy was like in the dark, assassin creed style, broody, cool as shit, edgy and stuff.

## Before killings

Name is Tahmelapachme Nakai, called Tommy. Got a brother, Tahoma (often is just called Tah). Mom's name is Unega, and dad's name is Amadahy. Dad was a hunter, he died when Tommy was 11. 

Mom became kinda abusive. Tommy and his bro became hunters as well. They're super close cuz they only got each other.

At one point, the hunting party that they go with, of the other members killed a sacred beast. But Tah got blamed for it. So it's real bad guys. They brought it to court, and because of the kid (the name is Mika) is part of an important family or sumn (FIGURE SHIT OUT WHY HE IMPORTANT), Tah eventually was the one that got blamed and imprisoned.

The real story (unknown at that point, or maybe ever to Tom): Tah was working with the Hunter's tribe, and he was trying to frame Mika by somehow making him kill the beast. The decision to imprison Tah was made by the Elder, who seeked the wisdom of the spirits of the realm, and well the damn spirits knew who exactly to blame. So Tah was the one that got fucked instead.

Tom got real sad and so does her mom. Mom killed herself (MAYBE NOT??). 

## First killings

Tom was all alone. Then he was about to end it all, but then a dude from the Warriors tribe approached him, his name is Kova. Offered him a chance for vengeance, training him and using him to kill (well at first) Mika. Then Tommy was instructed to again three other members of the hunter's tribe, Mika's dad, and the Elder (MAYBE).

Mika is from the fam white lily (from my tribe). There's a fam in the warrior tribe called black talon, they seem to have issues with the white lily. There are people from the white lily that goes to the council of 7. The warriro's tribe in general want to destabilize the hunter tribe, ie the amount of power and shit. Cuz they want more power, but why specifically the hunter's tribe?? no idea.

Mika's killing is when Mika is hunting with party, in the forest, at night. Then the tribe got paranoid. Elder proly ady figured its some warrior tribe shit, but not completely sure. Told Mika's dad, the head of white fam to up the security or sumn.

Next target: Mika's dad, Awena. Awena, although a hunter as well, has been told not to hunt for his own safety. So somehow Tommy gota break through security, how? no idea yet lmao, maybe got some help from Warrior's tribe somehow.

Last target: Elder, Chetan. Pretty sure he'd knew that he would be next somehow, but kinda already know that the asssassin is Tommy. Wanted to talk to Tommy, so sort of just let Tommy in.

Reasons for killing (unknown to Tom, I think): To disrupt the stability of the hunter's tribe for some reason.

### Relations with the Warriors Tribe

While he was under the Warriors tribe wing, Tom also lived with them (one of the convoy at least). He was given shelter and quite a family as well. Making him attached to the tribe. He was also given access to visit his brother (who's imprisoned in the capital)
## Departure

The departure (NOT SOLID YET):
	- Tah was working with the Warriors tribe right. but Tah going to jail is actually part of the Warriors tribe plan, they knew how the trial is going to be. It's cuz Tah fell in love with someone in the Hunter's tribe, but the Warrior's tribe doesn't want him to get attached and there were some business to be done in the prison anyway. So they sent him away. Tah is still working for the Warriors tribe cuz orelse they threaten to kill the girl.
	- Upon killing the Elder, the Elder revealed that Tah was indeed guilty, and apparently I ady knew that somehow the Warriors tribe is doing sus shits, but not terribly sure until recent assassinations (by Tommy). He shared this with Tommy and told him that they're just using him and he would be disposed once they're done with Tommy. Tommy kills him anyway. 
	- But then he started questioning things, mainly because now he's hella confused who to trust or what's going to happen. Found out nasty shit somehow, and got paranoia, so he starts planning an escape, but also with his brother. He eventually finish the plan of freeing him, and attempted it. Halfway of the prison break, something goes wrong, blah blah blah, but at the end, there's a dramatic moment where Tah just need to jump and grab Tommy's hand but refused because he needed to stay in jail to make sure his lover isn't dead. So Tommy escaped alone, and super sad.

# [[Tisa Bangaray]]

Sharav lived in a community of indopino people, the name is Tisa Bangaray (in [[Next Campaign/DM Notes/Location/8-10. Zankoku/9. Xianhua/Emerald Gate/The Emerald gate|The Emerald gate]], specifically in [[The Sapphire Wall]]). The community is quite close knitted, probably because everything is literally so close to each other. They help each other out and stuff. Tommy visits Sharav a lot and sees her helping around the community very often. This kinda rubs off on Tommy and he kinda got close to the community as well.

One family that they were quite close with, cuz they were direct neighbours, is a family consists of an old man and his son, [[Joko]] and [[Jaya]]. Joko, the father, has been sick for quite a long time, and his son Jaya had to take care of him. Jaya, since he had to take care of his dad, doesnt really have any other family than Joko. To make money, Jaya works as a scavenger and tinkerer. He just finds random shit here and there and make something out of it. Since Jaya is pretty busy, to ensure he could provide medications on top of food, Joko is often alone. So Sharav quite often keep Joko company, bringing extra food and things. And well Tommy joins them sometimes.

Tommy also helped Jaya with his scavenging and tinkering when he got free time. Shared sometimes some interesting places outside the wall that could have some scavenging potential, would venture out together. Tommy also learnt a little bit of tinkering, know some basics of mechanical systems. Mind that Jaya wasn't exactly super good in what he does, especially that he never really had access to education, so Tommy wasn't exactly any good either. He'd be able to assist someone like Jaya, but would not be able to do anything alone.

One notable person in Tisa Bangaray is [[Louisa]]. She is almost like the matriarch of the community, the grandma. She owns a small general shop called [[Waroeng]], that basically sits in the middle of the community. Waroeng isn't a mere shop, it is also the main gathering place of the community, despite its small size. Lota people hang out here in the evening. At first, Tommy would only come if Sharav is there, he was also rather quiet and only talked if he was spoken to. But overtime he got warmer with the people and would sometimes go without Sharav. He mostly listens in to others to know what's going on around the community. From here he knows some problems that went on in the community and helped some of them sometimes.

# Extortion

For a long time, the [[The yi ling ba family]] has extorted the community, just like other communities in the wall. They know that Waroeng is the main gathering place so they would only ask there. The whole Tisa Bangaray would contribute to the hefty sum that they always ask.

At some point, the community just didn't have enough money. At first the gang would just give verbal threats, then it escalated to random people beating and eventually just stealing goods from around the community. Unfortunately the people here really can't do anything, and everyone just takes the beating. But not Tommy, he hated it, he saw this as unfair and well he vengeful and violent instinct is kicking in pretty hard. 

One day, when the collection time hit, some houses were visited, one of them was Sharav's, well Tommy was there, and well oh well some people got beat pretty bad, including Tommy. This obviously backfired, well Tommy felt responsible about it as well. So he went to [[Next Campaign/DM Notes/Location/8-10. Zankoku/9. Xianhua/Emerald Gate/Rasa Jawa|Rasa Jawa]] for help. He talked to [[Farhan]] there and asked if there's anything that the family can do about it, after all it is a Mahilayan community. Unfortunately, since Tommy already sparked a fire, there is very little that they could do, especially since the Saphire Wall is a bit out of their reach. After also talking with the head of the family, [[Dini Ranggini]], they worked out that Tommy could contact the [[the Shang You family]], the Mahilayan crime fam would just smoothen the initial contact.


# Effect on relationship
Straight to punching at first, but then it fired back, and had to do more investigation. Sharav got prego, and shit in the relationship started to get more serious. Tommy got scared because he doesn't think that he's good enough to be her serious serious partner and a father, but he still cares about them. The way he cope with it is by very actively protecting the community, thinking that that's all he's good for, to the point that it's obviously too much. Consequently, it created a significant distance between Tommy and Sharav.

Sharav wanted Tommy to stay with them more, let other take care of the problem, especially because of the child. But Tommy was insistant that he should protect the community. This turns into a big fight. Tommy also told her that he is not good enough. Sharav even told him that he is and begged for him to just stay with her more. Then there was a fight about how Sharav was cold to him, then a fight about how Tommy was secretive about his past, how Sharav was also secretive, etc etc. But all this just screams "TOMMY GOT NO BALLS AND CANT COMMIT". After this Tommy just left.

Tommy still loved Sharav, was extremely sad that he had done what he did. However, Tommy still keeps an eye on them, asking the neighbours how she doing, sending them money. First directly, which then was declined, but then indirectly through Sharav's neighbours (who was also Tommy's friends).

She left town, no idea where, after a year from the breakup.

And again, he dealt with this by heavily preoccupying himself with the bullies.

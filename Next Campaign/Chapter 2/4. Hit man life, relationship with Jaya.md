# Jaya Joined

Tommy doesn't live in [[Tisa Bangaray]] anymore, of course. He knows that what he does is very dangerous and would put people around him in danger. However, there is one person just keeps trailing him, [[Jaya]]. This dude turns out to be a bit more resourceful than Tommy thought, proven by the fact that he could find him. He was very lost after his father died, and welp really wanted to get back at the [[The yi ling ba family]]. He knew that he couldn't do anything, but after suddenly getting protection from Shang You, and Tommy went kinda missing, he tried to find Tommy.

Let's just say that he put two and two together and knew Tommy did something to make shit better. He wanted to help, whatever Tommy did (at this point Jaya still didn't know what Tommy did). But yeah eventually, even after Tommy tried to persuade him to not help him, cuz you know it's dangerous, Tommy also told him pursuing vengeance ain't good (very hypocritical I know), Jaya was very persistent, Tommy eventually agrees with him helping.

Jaya made quite a sophisticated crossbow for Tommy, would offer him repair, made bolts, even went out of his own way to steal some materials and books to up his craft. Tommy does help him sometimes to ensure that he's not in big big danger.

# The Viper

The hitman life is definitely not a good life. He does get quite a compensation for what he does, on top of Tisa Bangaray's protection. He is however required to be extremely careful about his identity and needed to ensure that basically no one knows about his relationship with the Shang You family. Also because the yi ling ba basically extra hates him now. Basically, he needs to live very very discreetly. Going back to Tisa Bangaray would not be very wise. Sure, he could actually find friends in the "underground network" but yeah they're not exactly the best people. The only real friend that he has right now is Jaya, who still live quite far away from him, let's say they live in the opposite end of Emerald's gate.

The Viper is the name that he is known with in the underground network. The infamous assassin. It is not however known that it's correlated to the [[the Shang You family]], only few speculated, and even less actually know. This is because the assassinations that are ordered by the family seems very random. Sometimes it is members of the yi ling ba fam, but it's not uncommon to kill someone random. Sometimes it is some common criminal, sometimes it is a known member of a criminal group, but sometimes, it's also just non-criminals, at least from the looks of it. He has been ordered to kill some middle class businessman, upperclass business man, even one time a journalist who happens to just be a kid.

All this killing really numbed his empathy. He's coping by thinking that this is all necessary to protect the community, but in reality, he barely keeps contact with Tisa Bangaray, he doesn't exactly care about them anymore, he's just feeling lost, stuck, and invested too much in this.

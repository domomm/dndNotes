For general info on Sharav: [[Sharav]]
# How they met
Sharav was in a performance, being the "target" of a shooting circus like show. Tommy attended the show just for fun, saw her, and had a crush. He is a bit awkward in the approach but he keeps coming lol. I guess Sharav found it cute somehow. Sharav would be doing odd jobs here and there around the city, and more often than not, Tommy would randomly be there bringing gifts. Ranging from flowers to some mediocre food that Tommy find delicious. It's like a cat trying to win over someone, but the cat isn't that cute, and the cat is also awkward. Well eventually Sharav's walls went down and they got together.

Somehow Sharav just drives Tommy to be good again. He acts good usually only when it comes to Sharav, about other things its still the same. But as time goes on, Sharav helps Tommy becoming a better person in general. Sharav basically would nag Tommy everytime he ain't nice or sumn, or everytime he has to do sumn kinda bad.

Sharav's views on Tommy's odd, borderline criminal, jobs: She's not into it, she is sort of against it, but she understands where Tommy is coming from

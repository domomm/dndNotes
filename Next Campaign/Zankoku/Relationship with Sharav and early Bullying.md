For general info on Sharav: [[Sharav]]
# How they met and early relationship
Sharav was in a performance, being the "target" of a shooting circus like show. Tommy attended the show just for fun, saw her, and had a crush. He is a bit awkward in the approach but he keeps coming lol. I guess Sharav found it cute somehow. Sharav would be doing odd jobs here and there around the city, and more often than not, Tommy would randomly be there bringing gifts. Ranging from flowers to some mediocre food that Tommy find delicious. It's like a cat trying to win over someone, but the cat isn't that cute, and the cat is also awkward. Well eventually Sharav's walls went down and they got together. And from this point on, Tommy does not have a reason to run further, and he intend to stay.

Somehow Sharav just drives Tommy to be good again. Tommy for some reason that he doesn't even know why, he just feels very comfortable with Sharav, it's like somehow he knows that Sharav understands him, even before Tommy told her anything about his past. He acts good when it comes to Sharav; before the relationship is official, he would bring gifts that he thinks it's cool (not what Sharav think is cool, he wasn't that smart yet), and also just helping her with her odd jobs, or getting odd jobs, he did this even without her permission, which kinda led to problems sometimes. He was, in a way, controlling, but not in a very aggressive manner, it's like passive controlling. He would make her do sumn, but if she doesn't want to do it, he'd just let go of it (most of the times at least).

About other things beside Sharav, Tommy was still a bit of an ass that couldn't care less about others. He still does some illegal things to get by. However, he did become 

The reason why she understood where he was coming from, doing all these illegal stuff is because he did share about his past, although he didn't tell everything. He told her that she lost his family, his parents died, but never really cared for him anyway. He told her that he also had a brother, but then ha was gone. In the conversation it was defo visible in his eyes that he had a bad past, and was easy to see that he was not telling the whole truth. However, Sharav understood enough and know enough that Tommy didn't want to be asked more, and it even was hard for Tommy to share this anyway.

Insecurity and jealousy from Tommy, especially from the fact that despite his "best" efforts in being vulnerable, Sharav isn't telling much about her past. Lead to some self esteem issues, insecure about not being good enough for her?? think about how his "dangerous" tendencies might affect this.

The danger comes around this time?? And made existing distance between the two even further??

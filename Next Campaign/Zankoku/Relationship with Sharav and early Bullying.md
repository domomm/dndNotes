For general info on Sharav: [[Sharav]]
# How they met and early relationship
Sharav was in a performance, being the "target" of a shooting circus like show. Tommy attended the show just for fun, saw her, and had a crush. He is a bit awkward in the approach but he keeps coming lol. I guess Sharav found it cute somehow. Sharav would be doing odd jobs here and there around the city, and more often than not, Tommy would randomly be there bringing gifts. Ranging from flowers to some mediocre food that Tommy find delicious. It's like a cat trying to win over someone, but the cat isn't that cute, and the cat is also awkward. Well eventually Sharav's walls went down and they got together.

Somehow Sharav just drives Tommy to be good again. Tommy for some reason that he doesn't even know why, he just feels very comfortable with Sharav, it's like somehow he knows that Sharav understands him, even before Tommy told her anything about his past. He acts good when it comes to Sharav; before the relationship is official, he would bring gifts that he thinks it's cool (not what Sharav think is cool, he wasn't that smart yet), and also just helping her with her odd jobs, or getting odd jobs, he did this even without her permission, which kinda led to problems sometimes. He was, in a way, controlling, but not in a very aggressive manner, it's like passive controlling. He would make her do sumn, but if she doesn't want to do it, he'd just let go of it (most of the times at least).

about other things its still the same. But as time goes on, Sharav helps Tommy becoming a better person in general. Sharav basically would nag Tommy everytime he ain't nice or sumn, or everytime he has to do sumn kinda bad. She also dragged Tommy to the indopino community.

Sharav's views on Tommy's odd, borderline criminal, jobs: She's not into it, she is sort of against it, but she understands where Tommy is coming from.

Tommy shared how he doesn't have any family anymore back home and had to do things that he didn't really want to. It was defo implied that he did something bad, but he never really shared it. 

Insecurity and jealousy from Tommy, especially from the fact that despite his "best" efforts in being vulnerable, Sharav isn't telling much about her past. Lead to some self esteem issues, insecure about not being good enough for her?? think about how his "dangerous" tendencies might affect this.

The danger comes around this time?? And made existing distance between the two even further??

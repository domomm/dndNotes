#Wabanaki #NPC #Group 

The central tribe inhibits the [[Wiyasaka]]. They are also called the Tawiyechetl (pronounced ta-wi-ye-chetl)

This name is a combination of elements from different Native American languages and has a symbolic meaning. "Taw√≠ye" is inspired by the Lakota Sioux word for "speak" or "talk," emphasizing the tribe's focus on communication. "Chetl" is a term inspired by the Nahuatl language, which can be translated as "sky" or "heavens," highlighting their special connection with celestial realms.



**The Sky Tribe**: This tribe is known for their exceptional flying abilities and has developed advanced techniques for taming and riding large birds. They believe that the sky is the realm of the gods and have a strong spiritual connection to the wind and the stars. They trade exotic feathers, birds, and other sky-related resources with other tribes.

#Wabanaki #NPC #Group 


The name "Wapiti Owéyah" could be used for such a tribe. It combines elements from different Native American languages. "Wapiti" is derived from the Shawnee word for "elk," representing their connection to hunting and the natural world. "Owéyah" is inspired by the Lakota Sioux word for "protectors" or "guardians," signifying their role in safeguarding the land and its inhabitants.

Please note that while I strive to provide culturally sensitive suggestions, it's important to consult specific Native American language resources or seek guidance from experts to ensure accurate usage and appropriate cultural representation.

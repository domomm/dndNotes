#Wabanaki #NPC #Group 

"Miskwa Nókwe" can be a fitting name for such a tribe. It combines elements from different Native American languages to symbolize their coastal lifestyle and connection to the sea. "Miskwa" is inspired by the Ojibwe word for "water" or "ocean," representing their close relationship with aquatic environments. "Nókwe" is derived from the Algonquin word for "fish" or "fisherman," highlighting their expertise in fishing and their reliance on marine resources.




**The Coastal Tribe**: This tribe lives along the coast of the region and is known for their maritime skills. They are skilled sailors and fishermen, and have developed advanced shipbuilding techniques. They have a strong spiritual connection to the sea and believe that it has the power to both sustain and destroy life. They trade seafood, shells, and other maritime resources with other tribes.

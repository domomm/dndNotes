#Organisation #Group #Wabanaki

The Council of Seven is a council that decides what happens with the [[Wabanaki Capital]] and the six similarly-aligned tribes. 

Every tribe is built in a way that there is some form of codependency on eachother. 

The [[Central Tribe]] is the one that makes it possible for there to be communication between the different tribes. They use their birds and smoke towers to be able to alert the different tribes. 

[[Nakai's tribe]] does most of the hunting, while they do most of the hunting, others are permitted to hunt as well, but [[Nakai's tribe]] is allowed in places that other tribes are not due to the sacred beasts that live there. 

The [[Coastal tribe]] live off the sea and welcome in any foreigners that try to enter the country by ship. They share their food with the rest of the tribes.

The [[River tribe]] works around rivers and makes sure that water does not get tainted by any problems.

The [[Fire tribe]] is most well known for mining and working things like metal but also glass, they have keen artisanal skills. 

The [[Warrior Tribe]] are the defenders of [[Wabanaki]] and will be the first called in a time of war. They do impose their wills on other tribes. Sadly, the other tribes have difficulties making them respect the boundaries.

The [[Trade Tribe]] has connections with the traders of [[Al-Maghrib Al-Wafir]].



The name alludes to the amount of tribes that have influence there. The amounts of seats depends on the votes of those in the [[Wabanaki Capital]]. They can not vote for the tribe in the [[Wabanaki Capital]] as they will always be one seventh on the seat. 

In total there are 77 seats that are to be divided.

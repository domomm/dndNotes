Zankoku is written as 三国, meaning 3 countries. This umbrella name includes [[Xianhua]], [[Yamano]] and [[Hwaorang]].

By the critics it is often written as 残酷, meaning cruel, merciless and inhuman.

Under the previous emperor, the goal was to expand towards the [[Khunnu]] and the [[Te Waipounamu]] region.

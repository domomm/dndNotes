#Location #Organisation #Zankoku


Zankoku is written as 三国, meaning 3 countries. This umbrella name includes [[Xianhua]], [[Yamano]] and [[Hwaorang]].

By the critics it is often written as 残酷, meaning cruel, merciless and inhuman.

Under the previous emperor, the goal was to expand towards the [[Khunnu]] and the [[Te Waipounamu]] region. 

Ever since he died and the main concubine is in charge, the goal has been shifted to strengthening the bonds with these two nations. These nations are obviously skeptical towards the sudden shift in one emperor's lifetime as they don't know he died.

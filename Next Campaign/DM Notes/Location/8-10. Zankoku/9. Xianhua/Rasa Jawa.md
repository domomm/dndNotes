[[Rasa Jawa]] is a small restaurant from the [[Tala Archipelago]].

This is where [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]] and [[Sharav of the scorched fields]] would often meet up on their dates. For [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]], this was somewhat of cover-up story. He acts to just eat there but his main goal is to get missions from the [[Talaian crime Family]].

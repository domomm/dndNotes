#Location #Xianhua #City

The forbidden city is like the name implies very exclusive. The city inhabits the emperor, his 100 concubines and his guards.

In reality, the emperor has died quite a long time ago, but only the main concubine knows. She is the one who gives command over the guards in the name of the emperor and processes those who want to request an audience with the emperor. She listens to the request, but ultimately refuses them and says she will tell the emperor.

The concubines have started their own economy and culture. They practice feminine arts, like dance, singing, silkweaving and wielding their chi. They also practice masculine arts like shooting bows, swordfighting. They are not allowed to leave, yet most women like the freedom from patriarchic powers. Of course, some want to go back to their family.

The emperor hasn't officially been the emperor ever since [[the Royal Seal]] has been lost. 

The dynasty has been mockingly been called the nǚ (女) dynasty, because the head concubine seems to have all the power.

The forbidden city lies in [[the Chinese plateau]]

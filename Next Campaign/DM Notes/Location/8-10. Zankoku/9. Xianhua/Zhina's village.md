#Location #Town #Xianhua 
1.  **What did the area look like where you lived? Was it lively or was there no one around?** I’d say my area was a sort of town infused with the woods (ben een half elf dus maybe da die helft dan zogzegd wood elf is?) It was lively enough but I wouldn’t say toooo lively want ZO veel volk woonde er nie
    
    Smth like this maybe? Ma dan met de architecture van jouw worldbuilding

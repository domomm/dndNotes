#Xianhua  #Location #City

(potential name: the Emerald Gate or 翡翠门 (fěi cuì mén))

City in the [[Xianhua]].

This port is controlled by two opposing "Triad" families, [[the yi ling ba family]] and [[the Shang You family]]. [[the Shang You family]] started out around 300 years before the story started. [[the yi ling ba family]] came to be due to [[The first]] wanting to gain some control over the country that colonised [[Yamano]]. Due to another huge family being already in the city, they learned to work as discretely as possible with signals that only they would understand.


The city is in the West on the side of the [[Middle sea]].

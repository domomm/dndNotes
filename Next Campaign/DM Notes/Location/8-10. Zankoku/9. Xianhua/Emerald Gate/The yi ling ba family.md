#Organisation #Group #YiLingBa



The Yi Ling Ba family (一百零八) focused primarily on giving stability to the people that were terrorised by invaders and unfair treatment while [[Zankoku]] was trying to conquer [[Hwaorang]] and [[Yamano]].

The first goal of the family was to integrate into the higher echelons of "Xianhuan society". This is why they are way harder to spot to an outlooker. They will have something that will relate to the number 108. This could range to having it tattoed on the body as well as have it written in binary in the form of marking on the fingers.  

The number 108 is written as "一百零八" in Chinese characters. The first character "一" means "one", the second character "百" means "hundred", and the third character "零" means "zero", and the forth character "八" means "eight".

## Hierarchy

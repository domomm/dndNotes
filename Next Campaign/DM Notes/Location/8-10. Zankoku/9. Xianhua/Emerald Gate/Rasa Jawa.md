#Location #Store

[[Rasa Jawa]] is a small restaurant from the [[Mahilaya Archipelago]].

This is where [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]] and [[Sharav of the scorched fields]] would often meet up on their dates. For [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]], this was somewhat of cover-up story. He acts to just eat there but his main goal is to get missions from the [[Mahilayan crime Family]].

Interior, but should be bigger. That is just a side stand for fruits and drinks, not kitchen. The kitchen is in the back, not visible to the customers.

# General Info

It is one of the most recognizable restaurants that serves Mahilayan food. It is not by any means a fancy restaurant, its prices are set so anyone from lower middle class could afford. The restaurant itself should be able to serve up to 100 customers. Many Mahilayans come here to socialize and catch up with each other, it is definitely one of their favorites.

# Backside

The restaurant is also a meeting place for the Mahilayan crime family. Separated from normal customers, there is a VIP place where "business" people eat. It is defo more comfy with better tables and seats. This is where, businesses, either legitimate or not, go down.

# The Mahilayan Crime Family

They are most known for drug distribution and shark loaners. Tommy has worked with them in both regards. They would meet here to discuss business. They are however significantly smaller than [[The yi ling ba family]] and [[the Shang You family]], and defo cannot go up against them. The guy that Tommy usually talks to for his stuff is of a high position, but not the top. His name is [[Farhan]].

The family is lead by [[Dini Ranggini]], who inherited the business after her father.

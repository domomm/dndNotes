Komegawa (meaning "rice river"), [[Dom's character]]'s village

Okay so it might be up to change but so far I'm thinking that the village I grew up in wasn't the biggest. A dozen families in total who own the land here and there, mostly farmland, lots of wheat (or other plant that would fit the Japanese setting). Your standard rural area


Aside from my parents I would remember an old fishermen (might be linked to [[The first]]). One of the best entertainers in proximity, he would tell tales that sure would spark the creativity of a child. Another one could be a woman whose way of being taught me that you can do more than just work the fields. [[Komegawa woman]] She studied during most of her free time and eventually left the village to study further



### Initial idea

Instead of a small village in area, it is a small village in population. While the harvest and subsequent [[preparation season]] are very busy, there is not much to do aside from that. During [[harvest season]], the villagers from neighbouring villages gather around to help with the harvest and subsequent preparation. They then get distributed throughout [[Zankoku]] and [[Khunnu]].

Due to the spread-out nature of the rice fields, there is a lot of space in between villagers and this means that it is perfect to house militia. They can eat from the harvest while not impeding on space too much. 

The village was located to the eastern border of [[Kizunashima]].

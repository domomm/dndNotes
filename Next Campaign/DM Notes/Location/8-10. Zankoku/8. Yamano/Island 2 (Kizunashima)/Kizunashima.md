#Location #Yamano #Island

[[Kizunashima]] was the forefront of the [[Zankoku-Khunnu war]]. Over the years, there were minimal progression on conquering, but did seem to be able to push the borders forward marginally. 

The border of [[Kizunashima]] before [[Zankoku-Khunnu war]] was very insignificant, mostly a port town that was friendly with the country of [[Khunnu]] as the traversal without is nigh impossible. 

After the [[Zankoku-Khunnu war]], the border was pushed into the [[Khunnu]] territory, but not significantly so. A lot of the land was torched and is not as easy to use as the [[Zankoku]] hoped. On the border of [[Zankoku]] and [[Khunnu]] lies a stark reminder of the war that has stopped just 7 years before from the beginning of the campaign.

#Location #Yamano #Island

(Also known as Dragon's Gate)

[[Ryumon]] contains a lot of volcanoes and is mostly seen as the island that has been left alone by civilisation, altough there are some tribes of dragonborn that do live and guard their dragon 'master'.


The volcanoes are said to have fertile lands and make it a perfect place to live if not for the fact that dragons roam the land. 

The [[Order of the Scarlet Sun]] does exploration missions to look for ruins referring back to other ages.

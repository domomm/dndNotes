#Location #Hwaorang #Nature

The [[Korean central lake]] has been there since before the [[Age of Glory]].  During the [[Zankoku-Hwaorang Conflict]], the [[Hwaorang]] tried to create artificial canals to stop progression of land focused troops of the [[Xianhua]].  This created a [[Northern korean region]] and [[Southern korean region]].

#Location #Khunnu 

The Mongolian fields are vast grassy plains that stretch all the way West, South and until the edge of the [[Orkhon]]. The long stretches of field sometimes get varied by small hills. One these small hills you can see settlements of [[Mongolian Yurts]]. Some of the other hills are either vacant or they are disguised [Galeb Duhr](https://www.aidedd.org/dnd/monstres.php?vo=galeb-duhr). 


In the landscape, they will themselves in the company of [[Mongolian Horses]]. Some of them are wild, others are tamed and are hiding Mongolian warriors.

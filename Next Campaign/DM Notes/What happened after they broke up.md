### DM Initial draft

The relationship was short and both of them yearned for affection, but were not communicative enough to convey that they actually liked eachother. [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]] left eventually without giving good reasons. After 11 months, [[Zhina's character]] was born. [[Sharav of the scorched fields]] was confused, but at the same time elated to regain something that looks like a family, even if it was totally different. (3281) She had to raise her child alone as she had no way of contacting [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]] for the first 10 years. There was still a lot of prejudice towards people from the [[Khunnu]]. [[Zhina's character]] was bullied but she could push away the bullies with fire manipulation. Eventually, [[Sharav of the scorched fields]] was able to contact [[Tahmelapachme Nakai]]. (3291) He refused to have anything to do with the child, but did not elaborate why.

She eventually gave up on trying to involve some sort of deadbeat dad and tried to raise as best as she can. While not working a bad job at all as horse riding teacher, it was still hard to raise a child on their own. Eventually, [[Zhina's character]] sought her father herself, almost of a sense to find what she was missing and to understand where the feelings her mother hold come from. (3301)

# Hinduism and Buddhism
Basically, starting from the 5th century or sumn, most of the indonesian regions were heavily affected by hinduism and Buddhism, many kingdoms (based on those religions) rise and fall throughout these eras. One of the cool things about this era is the temples.

That is an image of the biggest buddhist temple in the world, located in central Java. Throughout this era, many other temples, or temple complexes were built. They still lasted till today. Other cool items could be rock statues depicting Gods for worship, like this:

This is where I got it from https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arca 

Obv there were many wars back then in expanding one's kingdoms as there were quite many. Indonesia was defo not a country as one, but rather different regions with different cultures that could be congregated under a certain kingdom.
# Islamic era
They got in through trade and stuff. They made some cool mosques and made a lot of people muslim basically lol. Here's an example of a mosque that they built:

A notable thing that they did to spread the teaching is incorporating the local culture to islamic culture. For example, in Java, there is an show called wayang. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayang. It's basically a puppet show. Although puppets are not exactly super allowed in islam, they did it like this anyway so they can integrate with the culture more.

Maybe it is notable to say that in modern time, using religion as a way to gain power in politics is not uncommon. 
# Colonialism
Well, not so fun, cuz they enslaved us, overworked us, divide and conquered the existing kingdoms, and yeah just not so fun time. There were portuguese (16th century only), dutch, frenchbritish (though only like a decade or sumn), also Japanese (which had worse slavery lol). Then oppenheimer dropped a banger and we set ourselves free.

# Different cultures

Indonesia is super duper big, and consists of 5 big islands and thousands of small islands. So yeah the people here are pretty separate from each other (originally), so there are very different cultures; different languages, different food, different rules and shit. Ima just give some examples:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_culture
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balinese_people
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sulawesi#Culture
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acehnese_people
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dayak_people 

And honestly many others, I didn't even read those wikipedia pages lol. From the top of my head, I can say that beliefs are strong for (probably) all of the regions, and thus we got some shamans, they're called Dukun. Here's the page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dukun. But basically they make things that weren't really happening, happening. Can put some curses here and there, but can also heal people or remove evil spirits.

Having different cultures also mean that there is internal racism here. 

Extra note, having a big ass country that is divided by many great natural obstacles (the sea) means that the modern government is not having an easy time spreading the spoils development to remote areas (relative to the capital). Java, the island where the capital is located, is much more developed than the other islands. The eastern part of indonesia, especially Papua (the big island in the west), is pretty undeveloped.

# Some ideas
Okay now you have those in mind, here are some ideas:
- An obvious one: very different culture in each island, even within one island is also possible. This pose also an interesting question: how does the gov handle this?
- Well there are no Gods right, but you said there are spirits and well it's basically possible to become spiritual. How about, historically, the region is very spiritual, but over the years things got more "modernized", this is quite like the current Indonesian government. 
	The original spiritualism that resided in the people is not exactly part of the modern government, or at least not a central part of it. However, the spiritualism is still there in the people, at least in some parts of the country. Let's say that around the capital it's all modern and stuff. But if you go to more remote areas and small isles, people there are more spiritual. 
- Shamanism can be a cool motivator in magic, combining that with the possibility of having very different cultures across the country means different flavors of magic within one country. However, hear me out, how about one of them be... NECROMANCY. But like, it's not evil or anything, it's just the culture there. You can have an island just full of ghosts.
	Side note: I think in the Dayak people' culture (5th bullet point in Different Cultures), there's some sort of necromancy magic where you temporarily make a corpse walk to their tomb or sumn.
- Well there's also the mythical sea creature thing that I had for my mini campaign, if you want I can send you what I have over those stuff.

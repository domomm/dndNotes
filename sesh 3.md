*Aianaye's Lotus from Xianhua. The lotus is a pin that holds a mantle together, porcelain, red and golden accents. Not far fetched if it was from royalty.*

Went to the milling mansion. Rishi here (Lakshmi's dad). 

*ethereal creatures in forest??*

Maya from the milling mansion describe that the woods are weird, same in Yamano.

Btwww the continent name is Oroboros. There's 2 moons, the first is the lion's moon, the heart beat (cuz every day it goes from zero to full moon in 2 days). But as of recent years ther's a third moon, the quantum moon. It wanes weirdly.

5 days travel. 6 people. Good fighters, but lost 4 people there. 5 days back.

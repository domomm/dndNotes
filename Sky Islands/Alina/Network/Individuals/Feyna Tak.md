Feyna Tak is a halfling professor in the [[Tempest Academy]] that taught Philosophy oriented subject in the Magical campuses, e.g. Fundementals of Self Preservation in Magical Practices (a course to not let magic derail your sanity basically). She is also the dean of the wizardry campus. Interestingly, she is also one of the professors that are actively involved in [[The Ascent]], and as many professors in the association, she is also involved politically in the political party that associated to The Ascent, which has the same name.

Since [[Alina Zym]] had to make a lot of contacts with many professionals as the head of the public liason sector of The Ascent, she had to be under supervision, Feyna Tak was her supervisor. Together they have managed to establish/improve relations with other academies, some powerful magical practitioner, scientists, and even some high political officers in Emmeryn (the latter is mostly for the political party of course). Feyna had basically taught Alina how to really behave herself in front of other highly important people and how to persuade different type of people.

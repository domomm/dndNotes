# From The Tempest Academy
Natalie Pynzky was the vice president of the association during Alina's presidency. She's a half elf who studied Sorcery for 4 years (specializing in Elemental Sorcery), then moved on to Thermodynamics and Energy Creation for another 2 years. She was actually the runner up in the election of the presidency. They share similar ideas in the campaign, their only opposite view lies only on the importance of recreational activities in the Academy where Natalie advocated to have more of them while Alina barely planned anything for it.

Natalie and Alina were already colleagues within The Ascent before. Although Alina is mostly positioned in academic liason and Natalie in event coordinations, more often than not they needed to work together as Natalie often coordinates events that includes outside relations. Their cooperation was good and no big conflict ever occured between the two. Their history is one of the reasons that they worked really well together during Natalie's presidency.

Outside of work, they are good friends as well. They happen to took some classes together in one of Alina's 4th year in the academy and went to lunch together sometimes. They bonded a lot through one thing: Their common love for coffee.
# Post Academic Year
She graduated a year after Alina did. She became a researcher in Sylvia for energy preservasion using wind elementals. After 2 years there, she got another job that takes her to the border between Ondinne and Lycea. The job basically researches the magical potential of monsters from Lycea. Natalie's job there is to see if the magic from the monters can be extracted for energy.

Natalie takes her vacation back home in a town in east Ophelia. But she does spend some of it in Emmeryn too, mostly to visit friends from the academy.

Alina Zym is the sister of [[Jaskier Zym]], our fallen bardic warrior, cherished member of the glorious [[Golden Sun]], and an intelligence officer of the Amber Wing. She is about 8 years older than Jaskier, and so at the point of Jaskier's death, she is 33 years old. She's always sort of the favored child, very obidient to the parents and follow the career path that her parents have set for her. She was set to be the inheritor of the [[Ring of Brass]].

# Family relations

Her parents, Aleksy and Aurel Zym were adventurers from another continents that brought...

She looks up to her hardworking father, always obedient. She spends more time with him than her mother, but to be fair, most of the time that they spent is work related. It has been quite a while since they've had a proper conversation without work involved. Overall the relationship is okay, but there is this thought in the back of Alina's mind that she needs to always make her dad proud.
# Academic Career

She's that child that studies hard and get straight A's.The only non-A's subject were mandatory sports extracurricular activities, in which she usually get C's. From high school to her years of Academy in the [[Tempest Academy]]. She pursued the study of Wizardry with a focus on transmutation (or conjuration, I'll see). She also pursued Enchantment of Magical Items with a minor on Trades and External relations. She spent studying in the academy from the age of 17 until the age of 25. Aside from having great grades, she was also socially very active. For all of her years in the academy, she managed to join [[The Ascent]]. A prestigous student association for the magical campuses.

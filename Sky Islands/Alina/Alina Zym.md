Alina Zym is the sister of [[Jaskier Zym]], our fallen bardic warrior, cherished member of the glorious [[Golden Sun]], and an intelligence officer of the Amber Wing. She is about 8 years older than Jaskier, and so at the point of Jaskier's death, she is 33 years old. She's always sort of the favored child, very obidient to the parents and follow the career path that her parents have set for her. She was set to be the inheritor of the [[Ring of Brass]].

# Academic Career

She's that child that studies hard and get straight A's.The only non-A's subject were mandatory sports extracurricular activities, in which she usually get C's. From high school to her years of Academy in the [[Tempest Academy]]. She pursued the study of Wizardry with a focus on transmutation (or conjuration, I'll see). She also pursued Enchantment of Magical Items with a minor on Trades and External relations. She spent studying in the academy from the age of 17 until the age of 25. 

## The Ascent

During her studies, she's made plenty of networks, for each year that she's in the academy, she's always managed to make her way into The Ascent, the most prestigious student association in magical studies (Which includes Wizardry, Sorcery,  Divine Magic, Arcane Technologies, and History of Magic and Ancient Arcane Practice. The association also allows students from other campuses to join). She became the president of the association in her second last year in the academy (she was 24). The association does all sort of things, here are 3 of the most important ones:
- Networking: Provide opportunities for the students to network with professionals such as Magical Items Traders, Enchanters, Divine institutions, sometimes even the Amber Wing. These professionals come even from outside of Ophelia. This is the sector that Alina really put forward in her period of presidency. In her period, she managed to bring the high druids of the (that big ass tree in Thalys), and The Head Scientist of House Borealis into the grounds of the academy. Moreover, the association also open paths for the students to study in other campuses in Goyou and even campuses in other continents. This is however only for Magic Related studies.
- Advocacy: The association puts a lot of importance on the voice of the students (including Alumni and teachers), not just on academy grounds, but also real political grounds. They have their own political party in the city of Emmeryn, in fact this is how it's possible for them to network far outside the city. The party's idea is basically putting forward education and pushing the boundaries of (magical) development. The political party itself is albeit not the strongest one in Emmeryn, it is however in the rise. Important to note that the actual political party related to the association is a different organization altogether, but they are of course closely connected. Students from outside the magical campusses join The Ascent often for this reason.
- The Trials of Fire: It is a relatively new magical competition that invites other sister-schools of the Academy into play as well. It started around 5 years after Alina graduated, however she was already a part of its very early development in her last year in the academy.

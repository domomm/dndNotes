# The War
Okay what the fuck is going on?! Definitely anxious about the whole situation, mostly about the safety of both of his family. Now of course also anxious about the mission. 

# His Father
Okay yeah this one weird, should talk to real life people

# His Mother

# The Party
Didn't get to really know the party, thought it would probably be just a short time thing to get money, but it seems like he's drawn to something bigger, and will probably stick with them longer. The journey to Belle can probably be a good time to get to know them better.

# The Golden Sun

# With Sharav
Got together cuz sort of fell in love, it felt good to be together with someone. She seems genuinely nice and unconditional, which actually scares Tommy.

See [[Possible effect of Trauma in Relationship]]. Tommy defo has commitment issues and vulnerability issues. This translates to some communcation issues in the relationship and also some emotional numbing (maybe). 

Absolute perfect answer why Tommy sort of abandoned his family but still protected them, but from a distant:
1. Abandonment and Commitment Issues: As you mentioned, Tommy has abandonment issues, which might make it difficult for him to fully commit to the relationship and family. Even though the good girl is helping him learn to trust again, his past experiences may still cause him to struggle with the idea of being emotionally vulnerable and fully investing in the relationship. This internal conflict could lead him to create distance as a way to protect himself from potential future pain or rejection.
    
2. Protective Instincts: On the other hand, when the community faces threats from a gang, Tommy might feel compelled to step up and protect them. This sense of responsibility and duty could be driven by a desire to prevent others from experiencing the pain of vulnerability and abandonment that he has felt in the past. Protecting the community can be seen as an external expression of his internal struggle to protect himself and his family from harm.
    
3. Compartmentalization: Tommy's behavior might also be influenced by a psychological mechanism called compartmentalization. He could be separating his commitment to protecting the community from his commitment to his family. By keeping these aspects separate, he may believe that he is shielding his family from the dangerous world he is dealing with, even if it means distancing himself emotionally from them.
    
4. Fear of Hurting His Family: Tommy might have a fear of unintentionally hurting his family due to his violent actions in the gang wars. By staying away from them, he may believe he is minimizing the risk of danger coming their way.
    
5. Coping Mechanism: Engaging in gang wars and violence might also serve as a way for Tommy to externalize and cope with his internal struggles and trauma. It could be a way for him to feel in control and powerful in a world where he once felt powerless and abandoned.

# Investigation years

Became very distant with Sharav. He is actually very saddened about it, but he kept telling himself that this is the only way, that this is to protect them. He is also sort of distant with his community, although not as much as with Sharav as he still goes to them to make sure they're alright.
# Yamano

When he had to lay low in Yamano, spending much time alone in regret, he realized that his behaviour with Sharav was bad, and that he should have stayed with her. At this point he started acknowledging the problem that he has and hoped to redeem himself one day, but too scared to go back to Xianhua (for safety and emotional reasons).
# With Zoey

When he met Zoey, it was like an opportunity from the universe to redeem himself. He finally gathered the courage to face his past in Xianhua. After fleeing, it is his goal to try to redeem himself by trying to make up for the lost years with Zoey.

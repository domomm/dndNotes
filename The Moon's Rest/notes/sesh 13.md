Malini keeps a mental catalog of politics in the ball. 

We went to Malam Nuragham, in 30m. Makeda is the shop owner, from another continent Amhara. They asked to murder dragon of soul. They also just asked to deliver followers. Lotus flower, 100% poison. We need to give it to Nakota or Talonsong.

Ahote, aaracokra from Wabanaki, from council of seven. He said I look like Nakota? Maybe just racist.

We met Nakota.

Information about the emperor. Live in a city full of women, everybody women except emperor. Everything is done for him, he doesnt really go anywhere. The emperor hasnt been seen ever. Because the head of concubine always represent him. This dynasty mockingly called Nu Dynasty (Nu means women). 

Head concubine is guarded by two guards. One can summon ox. Another one has gauntlets, probably physical fighter.

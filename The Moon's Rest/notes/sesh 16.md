A tale: 4 heroes of the continent. Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit. There was a force of evil so they had to team up? They managed to rid the evil. After a while the rat went insane with knowledge, ox too hungry for power, the rabbit wasnt satisfied with any new views. Tiger killed the other three. At the end of the day only tiger left.

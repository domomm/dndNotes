The unicorn horn basically makes you real high, deals piercing and psychic damage. 

Mirror's keep is an inn in Mayapur (the town where Temoc should be). There's a temple in the town, symbol is a pendulum which could represent a being of time. They honor/worship an entity called Pendulum of fate. 

Vision in temple: I was (I didnt know it was Nakota) as a child. I Bumped into someone, a teenager that has like blood in their eyes, like I shud not at all bump into him, it's Tommy. I fear this guy. Then time skip. See Tommy knife in hand running out of the elder's tent.

Mirror ball is a dance that this town do every year. 

Temoc, Occi's cousin in the shed in the outskirt of town. Greyish beard, looks like 50-60. Went travelling, and actually got old. Has been going around for 35 years. Apparently only gone for 3 years for Occi. They are much older than all of us. They were born like 600 years ago. They dont used live in this plain. Every year that passes for them is like 33 years for them. Apparently a woman infiltrated their kingodm, and found Occi's father... ??? Temoc was destined to be king... but then his father died in a tragic incident, makes Occi's father next in line. Ytti is woman who infiltrate. The emperor of the sun was Occi's father. Ytti became empress of the sun, after removing all of the advisors of the council. Supported by the sun church, wearing a huge eclipse hat. She's trying to do a ritual(???). Temoc doesn't think that's the case. He left because he wants help, but no one helped. The quantim moon is related to them, two peas in a pod. Some guy in Yamano listened to him, he said he would bring men, like an army, he got like 100. This is to stop calamity??? 

(Apparently priest is against Occi become king of his kingdom. He wants to do the ritual??? He is currently possessed by the Pendulum of Fate.

Mirror's keep is an inn in Mayapur (the town where Temoc should be). There's a temple in the town, symbol is a pendulum which could represent a being of time. They honor/worship an entity called Pendulum of Faith. 

Vision in temple: I was (I didnt know it was Nakota) as a child. I Bumped into someone, a teenager that has like blood in their eyes, like I shud not at all bump into him, it's Tommy. I fear this guy. Then time skip. See Tommy knife in hand running out of the elder's tent.

From Khunnu. Mankai, from the scorched fields, temporary Khan. Alone, without entourage.

From Yamano monnastery, brother Asahi ,sister Elira.

From Vriksha Raja, king and queen of the tree.

From Tianhua, Ms Mei Ying. Purple and gold clothings. Got a couple of bodyguards. One with a sword.

Nakota definitely hates me.

From Tianhua, Dragon of Soul (SY), Shuey Pu Sung (She).

_(The monastery come up with an announcement that SY kill people for soul magic. This is monnastery of Ren. Apparently they thought Ren was dead. I think sister Elira is Ren's sister.)_ Tommy doesnt know this

Nakota is part of the white lily family (the family I killed). She super wanted me ded. But now, because Jong Ming made a deal, she kinda made peace with it. And Im not ded.

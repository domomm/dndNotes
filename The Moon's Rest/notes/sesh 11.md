Tailor: Jin Xu Fang, 20m high. When we came in (in the second day) there's an elven woman who was kinda like a customer of a seance (Marijke's word), cool clothes, was wearing a antifaz (which at the end of the seance the mask is aesthetically on fire), black and white outfit. The other woman, who's probably the shop owner, got a fox mask. 

25m high wood armory, alokijadh bazar. The circle is divided in two. The trade tribe, sahoniye, is where the vendor comes from, his name is Winyanmaza. The other side of the  circle is the armor vendor, aaracokra wood pecker, Takoda. THey are both from Wabanaki, they know I'm from Wabanaki. Apparently hunter tribe is not doing good? the warrior tribe is trying to kick them out of the council.

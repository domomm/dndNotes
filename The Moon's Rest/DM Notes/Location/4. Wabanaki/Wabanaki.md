## Neighbouring parts

The Native American area lies secluded between a desert and mongolian fields. This means that as people they keep to themselves and try to respect nature and its spirits. It does trade with the neighbours in the West. (4,13,14)

The main structures work in tribes. There is one big 'modern' city and the rest are individual tribes and settlements.

They communicate with the big city by way of smoke rings. Every settlement has their own 'code' and that identifies them. Should the message be very important, then hawks are sent. 

The native Americans communicate with eachother using whistle sounds to show what is happening. 

## Settlements
There are 6 tribes/settlements that find themselves deeply intertwined in the politics of the [[Wiyasaka]]. These different tribes do have a connection with eachother. Some of them are in good faith, others not so much. 

Every settlement works with a system of tribe chief. The chief has the final say over what must done to the tribe internally. It is not done by the [[Council of Seven]]. When it comes to immigration matters, that is decided inside the [[Wiyasaka]]. 

The tribe chief is assisted by tribe elders. These elders are more in touch with the nature side of things and have been feeling left behind due to the encroaching globalisation. 

Next there is village representative for the [[Council of Seven]]. These are "politicians" that early one get sent to the [[Wiyasaka]] to learn and study. After, they can be elected.

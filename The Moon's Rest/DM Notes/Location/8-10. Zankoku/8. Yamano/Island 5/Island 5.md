#Location #Yamano #Island

[[Island 5]] is seen as the most secluded island despite its close vicinity to the [[Tala Archipelago]]. This is because on the east side, there are mountains that keep make access to the eastern sea difficult. At the foot of those mountains, one can find a monastery which holds a group of monks known as the [[Order of the Scarlet Sun]]. 


The are cliffs and mountains on the east, preventing easy access from the [[Indonesian & Filipino sea]]. In general, the climb to the [[Scarlet monastery]] is quite hard. 

The lay of the land means that the only ones that live there are in the [[Scarlet monastery]]. Aside from that, there are those who convey news to the monks. 


On the edge of [[Island 5]], there is an embassy of [[Xianhua]].

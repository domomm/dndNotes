### What is it

It is a city inside of [[The Emerald gate]]. It is densely populated, more than any other place on the continent. The city contains sparse amounts of sunlight. The citizens have found creative ways to get light. There are institutes like schools and a ceremonial courtyard.

### Who lives there
A lot of people who are not keen to be seen by the law. These are not necessarily criminals, but also those that have no proper say over a residence. We see war refugees from [[Yamano]], [[Hwaorang]], and [[Khunnu]], people disgraced and organised crime families. There is a strong presence of community within these walls. 

A lot of people still operate outside of [[The Sapphire Wall]]. They go to work, school normally.

### Why is it here

It used to be the place that the emperor and his concubines lived. During the [[Zankoku]] expansion,  the [[Emperor of Zankoku]] wanted to secure his safety and created [[The forbidden city]]. This gave rise to scragglers, squatters and refugees to slowly inhabit and transform the space.
